Code sometimes hangs when a player gets several extra turns in a row (critical)

If player has several colors that are tied for last, allow player to trade if none of those
colors is included in their tiles (nice to have)

Create more and better computer strategies (nice to have)

Once there are more computer strategies, allow a special option for a computer player that
chooses randomly between them (nice to have)

According to comments in GameBoard.java, something with the score breaks when P4 is a human
and P1 is a computer (unknown importance)

Sometimes clicks don’t seem to register properly (soft issue) (nice to have)
