Code sometimes hangs when a player gets several extra turns in a row (critical)
(could not reproduce)

If player has several colors that are tied for last, allow player to trade if none of those
colors is included in their tiles (nice to have)

Once there are more computer strategies, allow a special option for a computer player that
chooses randomly between them (nice to have)

GreedyStrategy has been observed once to hang at the end of a game (important)
