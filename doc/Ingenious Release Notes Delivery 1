Ingenious Release Notes June 2019 Delivery 1

- Don’t display computer players’ tiles during their turns (nice to have)

- When the player has fewer than six tiles and opts to trade, should replace
with the same number of tiles, not draw all the way to six (important)

- Fixed clicks sometimes not registering properly (soft issue) (nice to have)
